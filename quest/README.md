# Quests

There are generic data that will be persistant between games localization. Most of them will be here, and zoned one in its respective folder.



Files
-----
Quests' filenames are almost the same and can be suffixed by the language name:
 * **quest00.bin** - Offline quests
 * **quest01.bin** - Online quests
 * **quest03.bin** - Offline Arena quests

I really don't know where and what is the missing **quest02.bin** file, it might be downloaded in Loc-Lac city, not sure though.
